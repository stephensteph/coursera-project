    Pep Guardiola heads into his first Manchester derby with a 100 percent record following West Ham win.
    Perhaps it is a case of tunnel vision because, going into the first international break of the season, the old rivals are neck and neck at the top of the table.

It makes the derby on September 10 one of the most anticipated in recent memory - with or without Sergio Aguero.

While the striker’s potential ban for an apparent elbow on Winston Reid would weaken Manchester City’s attack - the imminent introductions of Leroy Sane, Ilkay Gundogan and Claudio Bravo to a side who have recorded five straight wins under their new manager is a daunting prospect for their rivals.

And that’s without taking into consideration Vincent Kompany’s return to a defence that is still to keep a clean sheet in the Premier League.

Manchester United's unbeaten start to the Premier League has helped the club build momentum before the derby clash against Manchester City. 
Marcus Rashford slotted in a winner in stoppage time against Hull City last weekend to ensure that Jose Mourinho's side were tied at the top of the Premier League on nine points after three league games. However, Rooney, who scored in United's 3-1 victory against Bournemouth in their opening league game, urged his team not to take their foot of the pedal against City, who also remain unbeaten this season. "It's early but you want to try to build momentum and especially going into the international break," Rooney told British media. "To go there with three wins is important and with the next game being Man City it was a big win for us, even though it's so early in the season. "We know whatever happens against City isn't going to define the season but it's always nice to go into that break with the three wins." 
Mourinho and City manager Pep Guardiola will renew their rivalry when the two Manchester clubs meet on Sept. 10 at Old Trafford, and Rooney said there was an air of excitement ahead of the eagerly anticipated clash. "It's a game players, staff, media, fans, everyone will be looking forward to," he added. "It's a Manchester derby but also with Jose and Pep Guardiola at Manchester clubs.
